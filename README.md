# HUMMUS_brain_cancer
High-precision Unveiling of Malignancies in the Mind Using Sophisticated Software is a classification AI capable of helping the diagnosis of brain cancer.

The recent AI boom inspired our team to apply machine learning to healthcare. There is a shortage of experience doctors in the market, especially cancer specialists, that is why we made an attempt at automizing one part of their job.

# What it does:
Our machine learning model looks at CT scans of suspected brain cancer patients and determines if they have a tumor or not. All this with an accuracy of 97%.

# How to use:
Dowload all files and run 'gui.py'. The last should deploy an interactive window requesting the submission of a CT scan image.
